## AWS Robomaker Small Warehouse World on Gzweb

![Gzweb01](docs/images/gzweb_aws_warehouse.png)

This Gazebo world is well suited for organizations who are building and testing robot applications for warehouse and logistics use cases. 

## 3D Models included in this Gazebo World

## Building and Launching the Gazebo World with your ROS Applications

* Create or update a **.rosinstall** file in the root directory of your ROS workspace. Add the following line to **.rosintall**:
    ```
    - git: {local-name: src/aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world, uri: 'https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world.git', version: master}
    ```
* Change the directory to your ROS workspace and run `rosws update`

* Add the following include to the ROS launch file you are using:
    ```xml
    <launch>
    <!-- Launch World -->
    <include file="$(find aws_robomaker_small_warehouse_world)/launch/small_warehouse.launch"/>
    ...
    </launch>
    ```

* Build your application using `colcon`
    ```bash
    rosws update
    rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
    colcon build
    ```

## Example: Running this world directly in Gazebo without a ROS application

To open this world in Gazebo, change the directory to your ROS workspace root folder and run:

```bash
cd aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models
gazebo worlds/small_warehouse.world
```

## Example: Running this world on Gazebo headless and running the UI on Gzweb
*Tested in ROS Kinetic/Melodic, Gazebo 7/9 with node version 8.11.3/10.22.1*

To open this world in Gzweb, There are two steps,

1) In a terminal, change  to your ROS workspace root folder and run gzserver with the small warehouse world:

```bash
cd aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models
gzserver worlds/small_warehouse.world
```

2) In another terminal, setup and run GzWeb
- Clone GzWeb and checkout the correct branch (follow http://gazebosim.org/gzweb#install-collapse-1)
- Deploy GzWeb
    - Approach 1: Copy all the Gazebo models from small-warehouse world to gzweb/http/client/assets/, and run the deploy script

    ```bash
    cp -r ~/aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world/models/. ~/gzweb/http/client/assets
    cd ~/gzweb
    export GAZEBO_MASTER_URI="http://localhost:11345" # change localhost to IP address of the gzserver machine
    npm run deploy
    npm start
    ```

    - Approach 2: without copying the Gazebo models, export Gazebo model path and run the deploy script with `-m local`

    ```bash
    cd aws-robomaker-small-warehouse-world
    export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models
    cd ~/gzweb
    export GAZEBO_MASTER_URI="http://localhost:11345" # change localhost to IP address of the gzserver machine
    npm run deploy --- -m local
    npm start
    ```

## Example: Running this world directly using ROS without a simulated robot

To launch this base Gazebo world without a robot, clone this repository and run the following commands. **Note: ROS and gazebo must already be installed on the host.** 

```bash
# build for ROS
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build

# run in ROS
source install/setup.sh
roslaunch aws_robomaker_small_warehouse_world view_small_warehouse.launch
```

## Notes
- Lighting might vary on different system(s) (e.g brighter on system without CPU and darker on system with GPU)
- Adjust lighting parameters in .world file as you need
